------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Integrator_one_step_test..." type scripts are used to generate plots of approximate solutions with no numerical stepping

"Magnus_Solver_adaptive_stepsize..." type scripts are used to implement adaptive stepsize numerical integrators for the RKWKB, RKF4(5) 
and various Magnus expansion based methods and plot the results.

The specific scripts used to generate the plots in the "Beyond the RKWKB method" paper note the relevant figures denoted in their headers.

The "Plots" directory contains all the plots generated in the project

The "Old_files" directory contains past versions of the scripts.
